## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Apple IIe preset** — `presets/apple2e.json`; ROM picker loads a 12 KB, 16 KB, or 32 KB Apple IIe ROM image; mounts 48 KB RAM at `$0000–$BFFF`, `AppleIIIO` at `$C000–$C0FF`, ROM at `$C000–$FFFF`; switches CPU to WDC 65C02; preset auto-sets ~1 MHz (17 030 cycles/frame)
- **`AppleIIVideo` device** — 280×192 green-phosphor framebuffer; text mode: 40×24 characters from embedded 128-character ROM with inverse and flash; hi-res mode: monochrome 280×192 pixel rendering; mixed mode: bottom 4 rows text, rest hi-res; soft switches `$C050–$C057` select graphics/text, page 1/2, lo-res/hi-res
- **`AppleIIIO` device** — keyboard latch at `$C000` (bit 7 = strobe), strobe clear at `$C010`, soft-switch activation on reads/writes `$C050–$C057`; `pressKey(ascii)` sets the latch with the strobe bit set
- **ROM `skipBytes` parameter** — `ROM::loadFromFile()` now accepts an optional byte-count to skip before reading; used by the Apple IIe preset to load the upper 16 KB of a 32 KB ROM image
- **Apple IIe ROM auto-detection** — `buildAppleIIePreset()` probes the file size: 12 KB → mount at `$D000–$FFFF`; 16 KB → `$C000–$FFFF`; 32 KB → skip first 16 KB, mount at `$C000–$FFFF`; ROM label shows the actual start address
- **Session persistence** — machine config is auto-saved to the OS user-data directory (`SDL_GetPrefPath`) on exit and auto-loaded on startup; last-used machine and ROM paths are restored without any manual save step
- **F10 auto-pause** — pressing Step (F10) or clicking the Step button while the emulator is running now pauses the emulator first, then steps one instruction
- **Author and copyright in About dialog** — About → The 8-Bit Machine now shows author name, email, and copyright year

### Fixed
- **VIC panel ImGui ID conflict** — five colour-swatch `ColorButton` calls shared the same `"##c"` ID; each row now wraps with `PushID(regIdx)` / `PopID()` to give each button a unique identity and suppress the Dear ImGui assertion
- **Spectrum 48K config round-trip** — `loadConfig()` previously only handled the `"c64"` preset type and returned an error for `"spectrum48"`; preset type is now dispatched correctly so saved Spectrum configs reload properly
- **Contained Devices after device removal** — `unmountAt()` removed devices from the bus and from `dynamicDevices_` but not from `activeFixedDevices_`; removed devices now correctly disappear from the Contained Devices panel
- **Screen panel spurious scrollbar** — a `scale >= 1.0f` floor caused the framebuffer image to overflow the panel at certain window sizes; replaced with `SetNextWindowSizeConstraints` (native-resolution minimum) + `ImGuiWindowFlags_NoScrollbar` so the panel resizes cleanly without a scrollbar

---

## [0.29.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Application icon** — `assets/icon.png` loaded at startup via SDL2_image and set as the window icon; `assets/` directory copied next to the executable on each build
- **Keyboard matrix in device panels** — CIA6526 and ULA panels now each contain a collapsible "Keyboard Matrix" section; C64 8×8 clickable grid (with MEGA65/Standard transpose toggle) lives under the CIA1 panel, Spectrum 8×5 clickable grid under the ULA panel; standalone "Keyboard Matrix" debug window removed from the View menu
- **`ULA::keyState(row, bit)`** — non-destructive read of the ULA key matrix; used by the Spectrum keyboard matrix panel

### Fixed
- **ZX Spectrum frame IRQ looping** — `irqLine_` was never cleared after being taken, causing the Z80 to re-enter the ISR immediately after `EI`; line is now cleared on acknowledge (ULA holds /INT for 32 T-states; the ISR runs well within that window)
- **ZX Spectrum keyboard matrix wrong** — row and bit assignments were fully inverted vs real hardware; corrected to standard layout: row 0 (0xFEFE) = CS/Z/X/C/V through row 7 (0x7FFE) = SP/SS/M/N/B; arrow keys now map to Caps+5/6/7/8, Backspace to Caps+0, Alt to Symbol Shift
- **"ROM target" option shown for Spectrum preset** — the MEGA65/Standard keyboard transpose radio buttons appeared in the Spectrum preset dialog because the condition checked `!preset.roms.empty()`; now only shown when `preset.keyMatrixTranspose` is true (C64 only)
- **ULA key matrix comment wrong** — documented row/bit layout now matches real hardware

---

## [0.28.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- **Keyboard not working on custom/default machines** — `buildDefaultMap()` now calls `installCIA1KeyHandler(false)` so any machine built without a preset has a working CIA1 keyboard; previously `keyHandler_` was null and all key events were silently dropped
- **Keyboard Matrix debug panel showing no held keys** — `keyState(col, row)` reads were not accounting for `keyMatrixTranspose`; panel now swaps col/row when transpose is active, matching how the handler stores keys in CIA1
- **Extracted key handler installers** — CIA1 and ULA key mapping switch tables moved into `Machine::installCIA1KeyHandler(transpose)` and `Machine::installULAKeyHandler()` to eliminate duplication between preset builders

---

## [0.28.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Preset-owned keyboard routing** — each preset builder sets a `keyHandler_` lambda in `Machine`; `Machine::keyEvent(sym, pressed)` dispatches to the active machine's hardware; `Machine::clearKeys()` releases all held keys; C64 keyboard mapping (with transpose support) and Spectrum ULA mapping moved out of Application into their respective preset builders
- **`CIA6526::keyState(col, row)`** — non-destructive read of the CIA key matrix; used by the Keyboard Matrix debug panel to show held keys without Application tracking them separately
- **`CIA6526::clearAllKeys()`** — resets all matrix bits to 0xFF (all released)

### Changed
- `Application` keyboard event handler reduced to two lines — `machine_.keyEvent(sym, pressed)` for captured keys, `machine_.clearKeys()` on Escape; no longer contains any machine-specific key mapping
- Keyboard Matrix debug panel reads live CIA1 state via `keyState()` instead of maintaining a separate `pressedMatrixKeys_` set

### Removed
- `pressedMatrixKeys_` from `Application` — superseded by direct CIA1 state reads

---

## [0.27.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **File → New Machine** — resets to a blank default address map (MOS 8502, VIC+SID+CIA1+CIA2 on bus, 64 KB RAM), clears any active preset, and stops the emulator
- **Preset-scoped device clocking** — `activeFixedDevices_` list populated by each preset builder; `clock()` and `reset()` only tick the devices relevant to the active preset (VIC/SID/CIA for C64, ULA for Spectrum), eliminating wasted cycles on inactive chips

### Fixed
- **Contained Devices showing wrong chips** — VIC, SID, and CIA chips no longer appear under "Contained Devices" in the Machine Designer when the Spectrum preset is active; `panelDevices()` now uses `activeFixedDevices_` instead of a hardcoded full list

---

## [0.26.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Zilog Z80 CPU** — complete documented instruction set: all unprefixed opcodes (structured x/y/z/p/q decode), CB prefix (RLC/RRC/RL/RR/SLA/SRA/SLL/SRL + BIT/RES/SET), ED prefix (block moves LDIR/LDDR/CPIR/CPDR/INI/IND/OUTI/OUTD, IN/OUT r,(C), SBC/ADC HL,rp, 16-bit LD (nn)/rp, NEG, RETN/RETI, IM 0/1/2, LD A/I/R, RLD/RRD), DD/FD prefix (IX/IY indexed, (IX+d)/(IY+d)), DDCB/FDCB indexed bit operations; interrupts IM 0/1/2 and NMI; EI delay (IRQ suppressed for one instruction after EI); port I/O via `setPortHandlers()` callbacks; selectable from the Machine Designer CPU dropdown
- **ZX Spectrum 48K preset** (`File → Load Preset → ZX Spectrum 48K`) — loads 16 KB ROM at `$0000–$3FFF`, maps 48 KB RAM at `$4000–$FFFF`, switches to Zilog Z80 CPU, wires ULA port I/O and frame interrupt
- **ULA device** — ZX Spectrum Uncommitted Logic Array: 352×272 RGBA framebuffer (48 px border each side); correct Spectrum pixel address decode and 8×8 attribute cell rendering; 16-colour palette (normal + bright); flash toggle every 16 frames; port `$FE` OUT sets border colour, IN returns 8-row keyboard matrix (active-low, upper address byte selects rows); frame IRQ every 69888 T-states (50 Hz at 3.5 MHz); ImGui panel shows border colour swatch, frame counter, and key matrix state; selectable in Machine Designer Add Device dropdown
- **Spectrum keyboard routing** — all 40 Spectrum keys mapped from SDL scancodes to ULA matrix (row 0–7, bit 0–4); Ctrl = Sym Shift; cursor keys generate Caps+digit combos; routing activates automatically when the ULA screen is the active display
- **Dynamic screen support** — `Machine::screenInfo()` returns the active framebuffer and dimensions regardless of preset; Application GPU texture recreated on dimension change so VIC (400×280) and ULA (352×272) screens both display correctly
- **`presets/spectrum48.json`** — Spectrum 48K preset JSON (3.5 MHz, single ROM slot)

### Changed
- Machine Designer CPU dropdown now includes **Zilog Z80** alongside MOS 8502, MOS 6510, and WDC 65C02
- `Machine::reset()` now also resets the ULA

---

## [0.25.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **VIC color RAM** — 1 KB color RAM at `$D800–$DBFF` (4 bits per cell); initialized to `$0E` (light blue) on reset; CPU-accessible via `C64IOSpace`; each character cell reads its foreground color from color RAM during rendering
- **VIC X/Y scroll** — `XSCROLL` (`$D016` bits 0–2) and `YSCROLL` (`$D011` bits 0–2) shift the character grid by 0–7 pixels in each axis; matches real VIC-II fine-scroll behavior
- **JSON preset system** — bundled `presets/` folder scanned at startup via `scanPresets()`; File → Load Preset submenu populated dynamically from JSON files found next to the executable; preset JSON schema: `{ version, preset_type, name, description, cpu, cycles_per_frame, key_matrix_transpose, roms: [{key, label, description}] }`
- **`presets/c64.json`** — Commodore 64 preset definition; drives the generic ROM picker dialog; replaces the old hardcoded File → Presets → Commodore 64 menu item
- **Generic preset dialog** — single `drawPresetDialog()` handles any preset type; ROM paths collected via native file browser per `PresetRomEntry`; dispatches to `buildC64Preset()` (or future builders) by `preset_type`
- **C64IOSpace as Machine Designer device** — `C64IOSpace` is now a fixed `Machine` member wired into `deviceForId` / `idForDevice`; appears in the Add Device dropdown (`c64_io_space`) so custom machines can mount it manually
- **Machine Designer — Contained Devices section** — a second table below the bus entries lists chips embedded inside container devices (e.g. VIC/SID/CIA1/CIA2 inside `C64IOSpace`); derived via `IBusDevice::findSubDevice()` with live computed addresses
- **`IBusDevice::findSubDevice()`** — new virtual method returns the address sub-range where a given child device lives within its container; `C64IOSpace` implements this for all four sub-chips; used by `panelDevices()` and the Machine Designer panel
- **Emulator speed persistence** — `saveConfig(path, cyclesPerFrame)` writes `cycles_per_frame` to JSON; `loadConfig` returns it in `MachineConfigResult.cyclesPerFrame` and Application applies it; C64 preset auto-sets ~1 MHz (16 667 cycles/frame)
- **CMakeLists.txt preset copy** — POST_BUILD step copies `presets/` directory next to the executable so JSON files are always present in the build output

### Fixed
- **CIA6526 TOD latch** — `REG_TOD_10` was returning the live `tod10_` counter instead of the frozen `todLatch10_`; reading `$0B` (HR) now correctly latches all TOD registers until `$08` (10THS) is read, matching real hardware behavior
- **Machine Designer address labels** — panel labels were built from the stale stored label string; `panelDevices()` now rebuilds labels from live `e.start` / `e.end` on every call so addresses always reflect the current bus wiring

### Changed
- **Machine Designer address validation UX** — invalid address values (Start > End, or non-hex) now stay visible in red after focus loss; the field pre-fills with the last bad value on re-entry so the user can correct it; Tab commits like Enter; the designer no longer resets the value to the previous good state on blur
- **`panelDevices()` label generation** — labels derived from live bus entry addresses plus `findSubDevice()` walk for chips inside container devices; no hardcoded address strings

---

## [0.24.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **C64 preset** (`File → Presets → Commodore 64`) — dialog with three ROM file browse buttons (KERNAL, BASIC, CHAR); "Build C64 Machine" calls `Machine::buildC64Preset()` and prints result to Terminal
- **`C64IOSpace` device** — dispatches the `$D000–$DFFF` I/O window to VIC (`$000–$3FF`), SID (`$400–$7FF`), colour-RAM stub (`$800–$BFF`), CIA1 (`$C00–$CFF`), CIA2 (`$D00–$DFF`)
- **`Machine::buildC64Preset(kernalPath, basicPath, charPath)`** — mounts KERNAL/BASIC/CHAR ROMs, creates `C64IOSpace`, wires three `SwitchableRegion`s (`$A000`, `$D000`, `$E000`) with RAM/ROM/IO options, adds 64 KB catch-all RAM, connects the MOS 6510 `onIOWrite` callback with the full C64 LORAM/HIRAM/CHAREN banking truth table, switches CPU to 6510 and resets

---

## [0.23.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **Per-device ImGui panels** — `IBusDevice` gains optional `hasPanel()` / `drawPanel(title, open)` virtual methods; devices opt in by overriding both
- **CIA6526 panel** — Timer A (counter, latch, CRA bits), Timer B (counter, latch, CRB bits + INMODE source), ICR flags/mask with green/grey bit indicators, TOD clock + alarm, Port A/B data and direction registers; opened from View menu per CIA instance
- **VIC6566 panel** — current raster line + compare value, ISR/IEN, border and four background colour swatches with VIC-II palette preview, CR1/CR2/MPTR with DEN/BM/ECM/MCM indicators
- **SID6581 panel** — all three voices (frequency, pulse width, waveform, A/D/S/R, GATE/SYNC/RING indicators), filter section (cutoff, resonance, LP/BP/HP mode, voice routing), master volume
- **View menu** — device panels listed dynamically under a separator; only devices with `hasPanel()` appear; each entry is a checkbox toggle; two CIAs show as separate entries with their bus labels

### Changed
- CIA1 section removed from CPU State panel; use the dedicated CIA panel instead (also fixes the destructive `read(REG_ICR)` bug where the UI was consuming IRQ flags every frame)

---

## [0.22.0] - 2026-04-17

### Changed
- **CIA6526 Timer B** — fully implemented; countdown at ϕ2 rate or Timer A underflow count (CRB bit 6 `INMODE`); underflow sets ICR bit 1, fires IRQ if unmasked; `ONESHOT` and `LOAD` bits behave identically to Timer A; TBHI write loads counter when timer is stopped
- **CIA6526 TOD clock** — BCD time-of-day with full carry chain (tenths→seconds→minutes→hours 1–12 + AM/PM); advances via `clock()` accumulator (default period 100 000 cycles ≈ 1 tenth/s at 1 MHz); reading `$0B` (HR) latches the entire TOD until `$08` (10THS) is read; writing with CRB bit 7 set writes the alarm instead of the time; alarm match fires ICR bit 2 and IRQ if unmasked
- `statusLine()` now shows both timers (TA/TB with RUN/STP) and live TOD HH:MM:SS.t am/pm
- CRB constants added: `CRB_START`, `CRB_ONESHOT`, `CRB_LOAD`, `CRB_INMODE`, `CRB_ALARM`
- `ICR_TOD` (bit 2) added to interrupt sources

---

## [0.21.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **MOS 6510 CPU** — NMOS 6502 subclass with built-in 6-bit I/O port at `$00`/`$01`; selectable in Machine Designer CPU dropdown alongside MOS 8502 and WDC 65C02
  - `$00` — direction register (DDR): 1=output, 0=input per bit; power-on default `$2F`
  - `$01` — data register; power-on default `$37` (LORAM=1, HIRAM=1, CHAREN=1)
  - Reads/writes to `$00`/`$01` are intercepted before reaching the bus; all other accesses pass through normally
  - `onIOWrite(data, dir)` callback fires on every port write so a `BankController` or custom handler can switch `SwitchableRegion`s — the foundation for the C64 memory map
  - `CPU6502Base::busRead` / `busWrite` made `virtual` to enable the override; no other behaviour changed
- `Machine::cpu6510()` accessor for direct access to the 6510 I/O port from machine-preset code

### Changed
- Machine Designer CPU selector now lists "MOS 8502", "MOS 6510", and "WDC 65C02"

---

## [0.20.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **SwitchableRegion device** (`src/emulator/devices/SwitchableRegion`) — proxy `IBusDevice` that forwards reads/writes to one of N registered child devices; `select(n)` swaps the active child at runtime; options can be any device type (RAM, ROM, I/O, open bus); `statusLine()` shows current bank and option label
- **BankController device** (`src/emulator/devices/BankController`) — 1-byte I/O register; `addMapping(value, region, bankIndex)` registers actions that fire when a value is written; a single write can switch multiple `SwitchableRegion`s simultaneously (e.g. C64 `$01` port); optional `onWrite` callback for machine-specific logic; `statusLine()` shows current value, region count, and mapping count
- **Machine Designer → Add Switchable Region** — Start/End address fields; "Add Switchable Region" button creates an empty proxy; tooltip explains wiring via config/preset; bank-selector dropdown appears live in the Status column for any `SwitchableRegion` on the bus
- **Machine Designer → Add Bank Controller** — Address field; "Add Bank Controller" button mounts the controller; tooltip explains mapping via config/preset
- `Machine::mountSwitchableRegion(start, end, label)` — creates and maps a `SwitchableRegion`
- `Machine::addRegionOption(region, dev, label)` — appends a child device option to a region
- `Machine::mountBankController(addr, label)` — creates and maps a `BankController`
- `Machine::addControllerMapping(ctrl, value, region, bankIndex)` — wires one mapping entry

---

## [0.19.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **BankedMemory device** (`src/emulator/devices/BankedMemory`) — N equal banks of RAM mapped at one address window; `selectBank(n)` switches the visible bank; reads/writes go to the active bank; `statusLine()` shows current bank and size
- **BankSelectPort device** (`src/emulator/devices/BankSelectPort`) — single-byte I/O port companion to `BankedMemory`; CPU write selects the bank, read returns the current bank number
- **Machine Designer → Add Banked RAM** — Start, End, BankSel address, and Banks count fields; "Add Banked RAM" button mounts both devices in one step; success shown in green, errors in red
- `Machine::mountBankedMemory(primaryStart, primaryEnd, bankSelectAddr, numBanks)` — creates both devices, takes ownership via `dynamicDevices_`, maps them on the bus; returns `nullptr` on degenerate range
- Machine config save/load extended: `banked_ram` entries serialise with `num_banks` and `bank_select_addr` fields and are reconstructed via `mountBankedMemory` on load; `bank_select` entries are reconstructed automatically (not saved separately)

---

## [0.18.0] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **ROM device** (`src/emulator/devices/ROM`) — read-only `IBusDevice`; writes silently ignored; reads beyond loaded data return `$FF`; `.prg` files have their 2-byte Commodore load-address header stripped automatically
- **Machine Designer → Load ROM File** — "Start" address field + "Browse..." button; file size determines the end address automatically (clamped to `$FFFF`); success shown in green, errors in red
- `Machine::mountROM(start, end, label, path)` — loads a file into a new `ROM`, takes ownership via `dynamicDevices_`, and maps it on the bus; returns `nullptr` on file error
- `Machine::unmountAt(busIndex)` — removes a bus entry and frees the dynamic device if no other entries reference it; replaces the previous `bus_.removeAt()` calls in the Machine Designer so ROM objects are properly released
- Machine config save/load extended: ROM entries serialise with a `"path"` field and are reloaded from file on config load
- `dynamicDevices_` (`vector<unique_ptr<IBusDevice>>`) added to `Machine` to own runtime-created devices

### Changed
- `Machine::resetAddressMap()` now clears `dynamicDevices_` in addition to the bus entries

---

## [0.17.0] - 2026-04-17

### Changed
- **Machine Designer panel** — fully interactive address-space editor replacing the previous read-only table
  - **Add Device** — dropdown of all known devices (VIC, SID, CIA1, CIA2, RAM, CHAR_OUT) with editable hex address fields; defaults auto-fill on selection change
  - **Remove** — per-row `×` button unmaps a device from the address space without destroying it
  - **Inline address editing** — click any Start or End cell to edit in place; Enter or focus-loss commits, Escape cancels
  - **Drag-to-reorder** — drag the `=` handle to change bus priority order; row highlights on hover during drag
  - **Sort by Address** — sorts entries by start address (stable sort preserving relative order of equal entries)
  - **Reset to Defaults** — clears the bus and rebuilds the standard default map
  - **Validation warnings** — red row tint for invalid ranges (Start > End), orange row tint for unreachable entries fully shadowed by a higher-priority entry, yellow text warning when no catch-all `$0000–$FFFF` entry is present; tooltip on drag handle explains the issue
- `Bus` — added `removeAt(index)`, `modifyAt(index, start, end)`, `moveEntry(from, to)`, `sortByAddress()`
- `Machine` — added `resetAddressMap()`, made `deviceForId()` / `idForDevice()` public for use by the designer panel

---

## [0.16.1] - 2026-04-17

### Added
- **SID filter routing** — Chamberlin state-variable filter (LP/BP/HP modes); `$D417` routes voices through the filter; `$D418` bits 4–6 select LP/BP/HP output mix; resonance applied as damping
- **Ring modulation** — `RING` control bit XORs the triangle fold bit with the modulator oscillator MSB; voice N modulated by voice (N+2)%3
- **Hard sync** — `SYNC` control bit resets target oscillator phase when source oscillator overflows; source routing matches real 6581 (`kSyncSrc[]`)
- **OSC3 / ENV3 readback** — `$D41B` and `$D41C` return live voice 3 oscillator and envelope values via `std::atomic<uint8_t>`
- **`roms/sid_playground.s`** — interactive SID synthesizer: keys QWERTYUI play notes C4–C5 on voice 1; VIC screen shows active key indicators and note name; border colour changes per note; loads at `$0800` to avoid screen RAM overlap
- **`roms/sid_demo.s`** updated to three sections: plain sawtooth+triangle → LP filter sweep (cutoff rises each note) → hard sync (V3 pulse at 1.5× melody) + ring mod (V2 triangle modulated by V1)

### Changed
- SID phase accumulator corrected to 24-bit (`& 0xFFFFFF`); fixes clicks/pops and off-pitch notes introduced in 0.16.0
- `generateSamples()` takes a register snapshot under mutex then synthesizes without holding the lock

---

## [0.16.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **SID audio synthesis** — SDL audio device opened at 44100 Hz mono float32; SID6581 generates samples in the SDL audio callback
  - 32-bit phase accumulator per voice; SID PAL clock (985248 Hz) used for pitch accuracy
  - All four waveforms: triangle, sawtooth, pulse (12-bit pulse width), noise (23-bit LFSR with correct 6581 tap positions)
  - Full ADSR envelope per voice with datasheet-accurate attack/decay/release time tables (2 ms – 8 s); sustain level 0–15
  - Gate edge detection starts attack / triggers release
  - TEST bit resets oscillator phase and freezes LFSR
  - Master volume register (`$D418` bits 3–0) applied to final mix
  - Register snapshot at start of each buffer avoids holding mutex during synthesis

### Added (ROM)
- `roms/sid_demo.s` — two-voice SID demo: sawtooth melody (C major scale, up and down) on voice 1, triangle bass drone on voice 2; ADSR configured for a punchy melody attack with a held bass

### Changed
- `SID6581::write()` and `statusLine()` take a `std::mutex` lock to protect register state shared with the audio thread
- `Application::init()` now calls `SDL_INIT_AUDIO`; audio device closed in destructor

---

## [0.15.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **SID6581 stub** (`$D400–$D7FF`) — all 29 MOS 6581/8580 registers modelled; writes stored, reads return `$FF` (write-only behaviour matches real hardware); read-only registers PotX/PotY return `$FF`, OSC3/ENV3 return `$00`
- `statusLine()` shows master volume, filter cutoff frequency, and voice 1 frequency word in the Machine Designer panel
- Config save/load recognises device id `"sid"`

---

## [0.14.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **CIA1 keyboard matrix input** — SDL key events are translated to CIA1 column/row coordinates and forwarded to `CIA6526::setKey()`; 6502 programs can scan the matrix via PRA (column select) and PRB (row read) exactly as on real hardware
- **Keyboard capture focus model** — click the Screen panel to capture keyboard input; Escape releases capture; a green border overlay and "KEYBOARD ACTIVE" label indicate active capture
- **`roms/keyboard_test.s`** — CIA1 keyboard scanner ROM; scans all 8 columns using active-low column masks, edge-detects newly pressed keys with a PREV table in zero page, and prints `CcRr` + newline to the terminal for each key press

### Changed
- `CIA6526` keyboard matrix (`keyMatrix_[8]`) added — active-low 8×8 grid; `setKey(col, row, pressed)` sets/clears individual bits; `read(REG_PRB)` ANDs all selected column bytes for correct multi-key scanning
- `CIA6526::reset()` now clears `keyMatrix_` to `0xFF` (all keys released)

---

## [0.13.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **VIC border colour** — framebuffer expanded to 400×280 (400×ACTIVE + 40px border each side); border region painted from `$D020` independently of the 320×200 active area
- **Character mode rendering** — 40×25 text mode; reads screen codes from screen RAM (default `$0400`), renders 8×8 glyphs using an embedded open clean-room font (`CharROM.h`); screen codes `$80–$FF` rendered in reverse video; foreground defaults to white (colour RAM `$D800` not yet implemented)
- **`CharROM.h`** — 256-entry 8×8 open bitmap font covering `@`, A–Z, 0–9, punctuation, and common graphics blocks; clean-room, no copyright concerns

### Changed
- `VIC6566::WIDTH/HEIGHT` now 400×280 (was 320×200); `ACTIVE_W/ACTIVE_H/BORDER_X/BORDER_Y` constants added
- Screen panel OpenGL texture automatically picks up new dimensions via `VIC6566::WIDTH/HEIGHT`

---

## [0.12.0] - 2026-04-16

### Changed
- **Memory Viewer** now uses `imgui_memory_editor` (single-header, from imgui_club) — click any byte to edit RAM live, built-in data preview and column options, PC highlighted in yellow, Follow PC toggle retained

---

## [0.11.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **VIC6566 (MOS 6566/6567/8566) stub** — Video Interface Controller device (`$D000–$D3FF`)
  - Full 64-register file with correct read/write behaviour; collision and ISR registers clear on read
  - 320×200 RGBA framebuffer; cycle-accurate raster counter (65 cycles/line, 263 lines/frame NTSC)
  - Raster compare IRQ — fires when raster line matches `$D011`/`$D012` and IRQ is enabled (`$D01A`)
  - `renderFrame()` fills the active display area with the background colour (`$D021 & $0F`)
  - Power-on defaults: DEN=1, blue background, light-blue border — screen shows immediately without ROM setup
  - `statusLine()` shows current raster line, background colour, and DEN state in the Machine Designer panel
- **Screen panel** now displays the live VIC framebuffer via an OpenGL texture (nearest-neighbour scaled)
- VIC IRQ wired to the CPU IRQ line alongside CIA1

### Changed
- `Machine::buildDefaultMap()` registers VIC at `$D000–$D3FF` (before RAM in priority order)
- Machine config save/load recognises device id `"vic"`

### Planned (future revisions)
- Character-mode rendering (reads screen matrix from RAM, renders with embedded font)
- Border colour and border area in framebuffer
- Sprite rendering, bitmap mode, ECM/MCM text modes

## [0.10.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **WDC 65C02 CPU** — second CPU implementation, selectable at runtime via the Machine Designer panel
  - All 27 CMOS opcode patches: BRA, STZ, TRB, TSB, INA, DEA, PHX, PHY, PLX, PLY, BIT immediate, zero-page indirect `($zp)`, absolute indexed indirect `($abs,X)`
  - JMP indirect page-wrap bug fixed (`nmosBug_ = false`)
- **`CPU6502Base`** — shared base class for all MOS 6502-family CPUs; `buildNMOSTable()` fills the 256-entry NMOS dispatch table; subclasses patch CMOS entries without duplication
- **CPU selector dropdown** in Machine Designer panel — switch between "MOS 8502" and "WDC 65C02" live; CPU resets on switch
- `Machine::selectCPU(name)` — switches the active CPU by name, resets it, and wires it to the bus
- Both CPUs are always connected to the bus; only the active one receives `clock()` / `reset()` calls from the Application

### Changed
- `Machine::cpu()` now returns `ICPU&` instead of `CPU8502&` — Application works through the interface for any CPU
- All direct register field accesses in Application (`cpu.PC`, `cpu.A`, etc.) replaced with ICPU getters (`getPC()`, `regA()`, …)
- Flag display in CPU State panel uses raw bit masks on `regP()` instead of `CPU8502::Flags` enum values

## [0.9.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Machine config save / load** (File → Save Machine Config / Load Machine Config) — persists the address-space wiring as a JSON file so machines can be recalled and shared
- `FileDialog::saveFile()` — native macOS NSSavePanel wrapper
- nlohmann/json v3.11.3 added as a CMake FetchContent dependency (header-only, fetched automatically)

### Config format (version 1)
```json
{ "version": 1, "cpu": "MOS 8502",
  "devices": [{ "id": "cia1", "label": "CIA1 $F100–$F1FF", "start": "F100", "end": "F1FF" }, …] }
```
Device IDs: `cia1`, `cia2`, `ram`, `char_out`.

## [0.8.0] - 2026-04-16

### Changed — Architecture pivot: general-purpose 8-bit machine designer

The project pivoted from a Commodore 128-specific emulator to a general-purpose
8-bit machine designer where you pick a CPU, add devices, and wire them into the
address space.

### Added
- `IBusDevice` interface — any peripheral implements `reset()`, `clock()`, `read(offset)`, `write(offset, value)`, and an optional `statusLine()` for the designer panel
- `ICPU` interface — any CPU implements `reset()`, `clock()`, `irq()`, `nmi()`, `complete()`, `stateString()`
- `Machine` class — owns all device instances and builds the default address map; exposes typed accessors for the UI
- **Machine Designer panel** (View → Machine Designer) — live table of all mounted devices showing address ranges and per-device status lines

### Changed
- `Bus` refactored from hardcoded CIA/RAM members to a priority-ordered `vector<DeviceEntry>`; first matching device wins on every read/write
- `CIA6526`, `Memory` now implement `IBusDevice` (`read`/`write` take `uint16_t offset`)
- `CPU8502` now implements `ICPU`
- `Application` uses `Machine` instead of bare `Bus` + `CPU8502` members
- Window title updated to reflect new app identity

## [0.7.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added
- **CIA1 (MOS 6526)** at `$F100–$F1FF` — Timer A with continuous/one-shot countdown, ICR interrupt mask and flags, data ports PRA/PRB; CIA1 IRQ wired to CPU IRQ line
- **CIA2 stub** at `$F200–$F2FF` — registers readable/writable, no side effects
- CIA1 Timer A counter, CRA, and ICR displayed live in the CPU State panel
- **Breakpoints** — click any disassembler row to toggle; run loop halts automatically when PC hits a breakpoint
- **Configurable clock speed** — Emulator → Speed presets: ~60 kHz (debug), ~500 kHz, ~1 MHz, ~2 MHz; effective MHz shown in the menu bar status line
- `Bus::clock()` — ticks all bus-attached devices once per emulated cycle
- Decoded address bus with reserved I/O ranges (`$F000–$FBFF`)

### Fixed
- IRQ fires only once bug — `setFlag(I, true)` was called before `stackPush(P)`, so RTI restored I=1 and blocked all subsequent IRQs; fixed by pushing P first (with original I=0) then setting I
- F10 now steps a full instruction rather than a single clock tick
- F-key shortcuts (F5/F6/F8/F10) now work regardless of ImGui keyboard focus

### Added — ROM tooling
- `roms/test.s` — CIA1 Timer A interrupt demo: patches the IRQ vector at runtime, starts Timer A, prints `CIA1 TIMER`, then streams `*` lines from the IRQ handler at ~5 Hz (at 60 kHz debug speed)
- `build.sh` assembles all `roms/*.s` files via ca65/ld65 before building
